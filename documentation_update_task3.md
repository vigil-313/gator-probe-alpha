I've completed Implementation Task 3: Configuration Loader Unit Tests and need to update the documentation. Here's a summary of the implementation:

## Implementation Results Summary
Created comprehensive test suite for configuration loader with mocks and edge cases

## Technical Details
- Created comprehensive Jest test suite for the ConfigLoader class
- Implemented custom mocking strategy for fs/promises module
- Used Jest's advanced mocking capabilities to simulate file system
- Created test fixtures for personas, templates, and settings
- Implemented test cases for all public methods and error conditions
- Added tests for caching behavior and cache invalidation
- Structured tests with describe/test pattern for clarity

## Changes from Original Plan
- Named test file config.test.js instead of loader.test.js for consistency
- Used manual mock approach instead of automock due to ES module constraints
- Added more extensive validation tests than originally planned
- Included cache behavior tests not explicitly specified
- Created helper functions to streamline test setups

## Challenges Encountered
- Mocking ES modules required special Jest configuration
- Jest's standard mocking approach doesn't work well with ES modules
- Had to manually implement mock behavior for file system operations
- Testing async code required careful handling of promises
- Needed to reset mock state between tests to avoid cross-test contamination

## Testing and Validation
- Created 21 test cases covering all functionality
- Tested success paths, error paths, and edge cases
- Validated behavior with missing files, invalid JSON, and malformed configurations
- Confirmed error messages contain useful information
- Verified proper caching behavior and cache invalidation

## Documentation Updates Needed
- Add testing approach to TEST_STRATEGY.md
- Document mocking strategy for ES modules
- Add test coverage information to implementation docs
- Include testing examples for future development
- Update test status in implementation plan

Please update all relevant documentation, including:
1. SESSION_STATE.md - Mark Task 3 as completed
2. Development/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - Update status of Task 3
3. Any technical documentation affected by implementation changes
4. KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md - Add any new concepts or relationships

Conclude session and prepare handoff
```

## Documentation Update Checklist

After Claude updates the documentation, verify the following:

- [ ] SESSION_STATE.md shows Task 3 as completed
- [ ] Technical documentation includes actual implementation details
- [ ] Any deviations from the original plan are documented
- [ ] New technical decisions are added to the decision record
- [ ] Progress indicators are updated correctly
- [ ] Cross-references between documentation and implementation are maintained
- [ ] Next steps are clearly identified

## Implementation Files to Reference

List the primary files that were created or modified during this implementation task:

1. `/Development/Implementation/gator-probe/tests/config/config.test.js` - Test suite implementation
2. `/Development/Implementation/gator-probe/jest.config.js` - Jest configuration for ES modules

## Key Challenges and Solutions

Document any significant challenges encountered during implementation and how they were resolved:

1. **Challenge**: ES module mocking - Solution: Implemented custom mock functions with jest.fn()
2. **Challenge**: Simulating file system operations - Solution: Created mock implementations that return predetermined data
3. **Challenge**: Test isolation - Solution: Reset mock state in beforeEach hooks
4. **Challenge**: Testing async errors - Solution: Used Jest's .rejects matchers with proper error assertions

## Next Steps

- Run the next implementation task:
  `./generate_dev_session.sh 4`

- Or update documentation for the next completed task:
  `./update_documentation.sh 4 "Brief implementation summary"`
