# Gator Persona Configuration Schema

## Document ID
[DOC-TECH-PERS-1]

## Overview
This document defines the JSON schema for configuring gator personas in the VALUGATOR Probe Alpha. The schema is designed to capture all relevant aspects of a gator's personality, expertise, and interaction style to enable consistent and distinctive character responses through the LLM API.

## Usage in Prompt Construction

When assembling prompts for the LLM API, the persona configuration will be translated into system instructions that guide the AI to respond in character. Key aspects include:

1. **Role Definition**: Using the archetype and expertise areas to define the AI's role
2. **Response Style**: Using tone, critique style, and response patterns to shape how responses are formatted
3. **Evaluation Framework**: Using evaluation focus to guide what aspects of the user input to address

## Extensibility

The schema is designed to be extensible for future gator personas while maintaining consistency. New personas can be added by creating additional JSON files following this schema.
