# VALUGATOR Probe Alpha: Technical Documentation

## Purpose
Technical-level documentation for the VALUGATOR Probe Alpha project, which aims to validate AI-powered "gator" characters' interaction with users, specifically testing tone accuracy, persona realism, and the prompt-response loop.

## Technical Focus Areas

1. **Gator Persona Configuration**
   - JSON schema for defining all 29 gator personas across three panels
   - Tone and expertise area specification
   - Panel-specific interaction patterns

2. **Prompt Assembly**
   - System for combining gator persona with user input
   - Panel-specific templates (evaluation, pathfinder, legal)
   - Optimization for character consistency

3. **LLM API Integration**
   - Communication with Claude or GPT-4o API
   - Environment variable management
   - Request/response handling

4. **Minimal HTML/JS Interface**
   - Simple form for pitch submission
   - Gator selection interface
   - Basic response display functionality

5. **Legal Compliance** ⚠️
   - Limitations and appropriate use of legal personas
   - Mandatory disclaimers for legal content
   - Risk mitigation for simulated legal advice

## Document Inventory

- [DOC-TECH-PERS-1]: [Persona Schema](PERSONA_SCHEMA.md)
- [DOC-TECH-PROM-1]: [Prompt Assembly Architecture](PROMPT_ASSEMBLY.md)
- [DOC-TECH-API-1]: [API Integration](API_INTEGRATION.md)
- [DOC-TECH-UI-1]: [User Interface Design](USER_INTERFACE.md)
- [DOC-TECH-STRUCT-1]: [Project Structure](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md)
- [DOC-GATOR-LAW-TRUTH-001]: [Legal Gator Limits & Reliability](LEGAL_GATOR_LIMITS.md) ⚠️

## Legal Documentation

The [Legal Gator Limits & Reliability](LEGAL_GATOR_LIMITS.md) document is a critical reference that outlines the capabilities and limitations of our legal AI personas. It establishes clear boundaries for acceptable use cases and includes mandatory disclaimers that must be included in all legal gator interactions. All developers working on the legal panel functionality must thoroughly review this document.

Key implementation requirements:
- Legal gator responses must ALWAYS include the standard disclaimer
- UI must clearly indicate the non-attorney status of legal gators
- System must detect and handle requests that exceed legal gator capabilities
- Documentation must emphasize educational vs. advisory nature of legal content
