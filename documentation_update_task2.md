I've completed Implementation Task 2: Configuration Loader Module and need to update the documentation. Here's a summary of the implementation:

## Implementation Results Summary
Implemented configuration loader module with clean API, validation, and error handling

## Technical Details
- Created a class-based configuration loader (`ConfigLoader`) with a clean API
- Implemented a custom error class (`ConfigError`) with error codes and file information
- Used async/await pattern with fs/promises for file operations
- Implemented caching system to minimize file system access
- Created validation for persona, template, and settings configurations
- Added panel type detection for loading personas across different directories
- Implemented a provider pattern for extensibility
- Added support for default values when settings are missing

## Changes from Original Plan
- Added caching mechanism that wasn't explicitly specified in original plan
- Implemented a more robust error handling system with custom error classes
- Added helper method to retrieve all available persona IDs by panel type
- Expanded validation to include nested structures and required fields
- Implemented file path resolution to ensure consistent paths across platforms

## Challenges Encountered
- ES module support in Jest required special configuration
- Mocking file system operations in ESM environment was challenging
- Needed to handle nested object validation for complex persona structures
- Panel type detection required searching across multiple directories
- Cache invalidation strategy needed to be carefully implemented

## Testing and Validation
- Created comprehensive test suite with mock file system
- Tests cover success paths, error paths, and edge cases
- Validated behavior with missing files, invalid JSON, and malformed configurations
- Tested caching behavior and cache invalidation
- Known limitation: ES module testing in Jest required workarounds

## Documentation Updates Needed
- Add ConfigLoader to technical documentation with API reference
- Update KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md with configuration concepts
- Update implementation sequence progress in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- Add documentation on error handling patterns
- Add usage examples for configuration loading

Please update all relevant documentation, including:
1. SESSION_STATE.md - Mark Task 2 as completed
2. Development/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - Update status of Task 2
3. Any technical documentation affected by implementation changes
4. KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md - Add any new concepts or relationships

Conclude session and prepare handoff
```

## Documentation Update Checklist

After Claude updates the documentation, verify the following:

- [ ] SESSION_STATE.md shows Task 2 as completed
- [ ] Technical documentation includes actual implementation details
- [ ] Any deviations from the original plan are documented
- [ ] New technical decisions are added to the decision record
- [ ] Progress indicators are updated correctly
- [ ] Cross-references between documentation and implementation are maintained
- [ ] Next steps are clearly identified

## Implementation Files to Reference

List the primary files that were created or modified during this implementation task:

1. `/Development/Implementation/gator-probe/src/config/loader.js` - Main implementation of ConfigLoader
2. `/Development/Implementation/gator-probe/src/config/index.js` - Exports and API
3. `/Development/Implementation/gator-probe/tests/config/config.test.js` - Test suite

## Key Challenges and Solutions

Document any significant challenges encountered during implementation and how they were resolved:

1. **Challenge**: ES module support in Jest - Solution: Used proper Jest configuration for ESM
2. **Challenge**: Complex file system mocking - Solution: Created custom mock implementation
3. **Challenge**: Panel type detection across directories - Solution: Implemented search algorithm with caching
4. **Challenge**: Validation of complex nested structures - Solution: Created recursive validation strategies

## Next Steps

- Run the next implementation task:
  `./generate_dev_session.sh 3`

- Or update documentation for the next completed task:
  `./update_documentation.sh 3 "Brief implementation summary"`
