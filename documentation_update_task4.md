I've completed Implementation Task 4: Prompt Assembly Module and need to update the documentation. Here's a summary of the implementation:

## Implementation Results Summary
Implemented prompt assembly module with template processing, variable replacement, and panel type inference

## Technical Details
The prompt assembly module was implemented in the `/src/prompt/` directory with the following components:

1. **PromptAssembler class** - A class-based implementation that provides a clean API for generating prompts.
   - Accepts a configuration loader instance in its constructor for flexibility
   - Provides methods for assembling complete prompts from persona configurations and user input
   - Implements template variable replacement with support for nested properties
   - Offers panel type inference capabilities to determine appropriate templates

2. **Template Processing** - Implemented a robust template variable replacement system:
   - Support for simple variables using {{variable}} syntax
   - Support for nested object access with dot notation ({{object.property.nestedProperty}})
   - Support for array iteration with {{#array}}...{{/array}} blocks
   - Special handling for the {{.}} symbol within array blocks
   - Proper formatting of arrays and complex objects

3. **Error Handling** - Created a custom `PromptError` class with:
   - Specific error codes for different error types
   - Descriptive error messages
   - Additional error details when appropriate
   - Comprehensive error handling for missing personas, invalid templates, and other edge cases

4. **User Input Handling** - Implemented proper sanitization of user input to:
   - Prevent template injection by escaping template markers
   - Handle null or undefined inputs gracefully
   - Convert non-string inputs to appropriate string representations
   - Clean input with proper trimming

5. **Module Exports** - Structured exports to provide both singleton and class access:
   - Default export of a singleton PromptAssembler instance
   - Named export of the PromptAssembler class for custom instantiation
   - Named export of the PromptError class for error handling

## Changes from Original Plan
The implementation adheres closely to the original plan with a few enhancements:

1. The template processing was expanded to include more robust array iteration handling than initially specified, allowing for more complex template patterns.

2. Added a more comprehensive error handling system with specific error codes and detailed error messages to aid in debugging.

3. The module exports were structured to provide both a singleton instance for simple use cases and class exports for more customized applications.

## Challenges Encountered
1. **Template Syntax Complexity** - Balancing the need for a rich template syntax with implementation complexity was challenging. The solution was to implement a staged processing approach, first handling array iterations and then handling variable replacement.

2. **Nested Object Access** - Accessing deeply nested properties in persona configurations required careful implementation to avoid errors with undefined intermediate objects. This was solved with a recursive descent method.

3. **Error Propagation** - Ensuring appropriate error information was propagated through the promise chain required careful design of the error handling system. The custom PromptError class with error codes solved this.

4. **Input Sanitization** - Properly sanitizing user input to prevent template injection while maintaining the input's meaning required careful implementation.

## Testing and Validation
The implementation was validated against the requirements:

1. All public methods were tested with appropriate unit tests
2. Template processing was verified for various scenarios including:
   - Simple variable replacement
   - Nested object property access
   - Array iteration
   - Edge cases like null values and special characters

3. Error handling was verified for common scenarios:
   - Missing persona configurations
   - Invalid template syntax
   - Missing required variables
   - API error propagation

## Documentation Updates Needed
The following documentation updates are needed:

1. Update the Prompt Assembly section in the Technical documentation
2. Add examples of template processing to the developer documentation
3. Update diagrams showing the interaction between the prompt assembly module and other components
4. Document the error handling approach for consistent patterns across modules

Please update all relevant documentation, including:
1. SESSION_STATE.md - Mark Task 4 as completed
2. Development/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - Update status of Task 4
3. Any technical documentation affected by implementation changes
4. KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md - Add any new concepts or relationships

Conclude session and prepare handoff
```

## Documentation Update Checklist

After Claude updates the documentation, verify the following:

- [ ] SESSION_STATE.md shows Task 4 as completed
- [ ] Technical documentation includes actual implementation details
- [ ] Any deviations from the original plan are documented
- [ ] New technical decisions are added to the decision record
- [ ] Progress indicators are updated correctly
- [ ] Cross-references between documentation and implementation are maintained
- [ ] Next steps are clearly identified

## Implementation Files to Reference

List the primary files that were created or modified during this implementation task:

1. `/src/prompt/assembler.js` - Main implementation of the PromptAssembler class and error handling
2. `/src/prompt/index.js` - Module exports and singleton instance

## Key Challenges and Solutions

Document any significant challenges encountered during implementation and how they were resolved:

1. **Template Processing Complexity** - Implemented a two-phase processing approach, first handling array iterations and then variable replacements
2. **Error Handling** - Created a custom PromptError class with structured error codes and details
3. **Module Architecture** - Used class-based design with dependency injection for better testability and extensibility

## Next Steps

- Run the next implementation task:
  `./generate_dev_session.sh 5`

- Or update documentation for the next completed task:
  `./update_documentation.sh 5 "Brief implementation summary"`
