I've completed Implementation Task 9: Express Server Unit Tests and need to update the documentation. Here's a summary of the implementation:

## Implementation Results Summary
Implemented comprehensive tests for the Express server to verify API endpoints, middleware, error handling, and integration with other components. All tests are passing with good coverage.

## Technical Details
The implementation of the Express server tests includes:

1. **Test Structure**:
   - Tests organized into logical groups for each API endpoint and feature
   - Comprehensive test suite covering basic routes, API endpoints, and error handling
   - Each test focuses on a specific functionality or requirement

2. **Testing Technologies**:
   - Jest as the test runner and assertion library
   - Supertest for HTTP request simulation
   - Jest's mocking capabilities for dependency isolation

3. **Mocking Strategy**:
   - Created spies for all external dependencies (configLoader, promptAssembler, llmClient)
   - Implemented mock implementations for complex function responses
   - Used Jest's beforeEach to reset mocks between tests

4. **Test Coverage**:
   - 18 distinct test cases covering all server functionality
   - All API endpoints tested for success and various error conditions
   - Middleware functionality tested including validation and error handling

## Changes from Original Plan
The implementation followed the original plan closely, with some improvements:

1. **Additional Tests**:
   - Added tests for the new `/api/personas/:id` endpoint
   - Added more thorough error handling tests
   - Expanded testing of SPA support functionality

2. **Testing Approach**:
   - Used Jest's spying functionality instead of complete mock replacement
   - Created more granular test cases for better isolation and clarity

## Challenges Encountered
Several challenges were addressed during implementation:

1. **Mocking Complexity**: 
   - Initial approach with complete dependency mocking caused test failures
   - Solution: Switch to Jest's spyOn for more flexible and less intrusive mocking
   
2. **Error Class Testing**:
   - Error objects from custom classes weren't properly recognized in error handlers
   - Solution: Updated error handling to check error name property in addition to instanceof checks

3. **Test Isolation**:
   - Ensuring tests don't interfere with each other was challenging
   - Solution: Proper mock resetting between tests and careful test ordering

## Testing and Validation
The testing implementation went through multiple iterations to ensure quality:

1. **Test Verification**:
   - All tests are now passing successfully
   - Tests verify both success and error scenarios
   - Tests check proper integration between components

2. **Edge Case Testing**:
   - Invalid input validation
   - Error propagation from dependencies
   - HTTP status code mapping for different error types
   - Graceful handling of various error conditions

3. **Dependency Testing**:
   - Verified error propagation from configLoader, promptAssembler, and llmClient
   - Verified correct interactions between server and dependencies

## Documentation Updates Needed
The following documentation updates are needed:

1. **Test Strategy Updates**:
   - Document the testing approach for API endpoints
   - Document the mocking strategy for dependencies
   - Document error handling test approaches

2. **Testing Documentation**:
   - Update test coverage information
   - Document the different test groups and their purposes
   - Add information about running the tests

3. **Implementation Status Updates**:
   - Update task completion status in relevant documents
   - Update the project progress indicators

Please update all relevant documentation, including:
1. SESSION_STATE.md - Mark Task 9 as completed
2. Development/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - Update status of Task 9
3. Any technical documentation affected by implementation changes
4. KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md - Add any new concepts or relationships

Conclude session and prepare handoff
```

## Documentation Update Checklist

After Claude updates the documentation, verify the following:

- [ ] SESSION_STATE.md shows Task 9 as completed
- [ ] Technical documentation includes actual implementation details
- [ ] Any deviations from the original plan are documented
- [ ] New technical decisions are added to the decision record
- [ ] Progress indicators are updated correctly
- [ ] Cross-references between documentation and implementation are maintained
- [ ] Next steps are clearly identified

## Implementation Files to Reference

The primary files that were created or modified during this implementation task:

1. `tests/integration/server.test.js` - Comprehensive Express server tests
2. `src/server.js` - Updated to improve error handling for better testability

## Key Challenges and Solutions

The key challenges encountered during implementation and their solutions:

1. **Challenge**: Mocking dependencies for isolated testing
   **Solution**: Used Jest spyOn instead of full module mocks for more flexible test control

2. **Challenge**: Error type checking in error handling middleware
   **Solution**: Enhanced error checking to use both instanceof and error.name for more reliable type detection

3. **Challenge**: Test isolation to prevent test interference
   **Solution**: Properly reset mocks between tests and designed tests for independence

## Next Steps

- Run the next implementation task:
  `./generate_dev_session.sh 10`

- Or update documentation for the next completed task:
  `./update_documentation.sh 10 "Brief implementation summary"`
