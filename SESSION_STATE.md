## Knowledge State
The VALUGATOR Probe Alpha project is progressing with significant achievements in configuration setup. We have successfully defined a JSON schema for gator personas and created configurations for all 29 personas across three panel types: Evaluation Chamber (13 personas), Pathfinder Council (9 personas), and Legal Panel (7 personas).

The prompt templates for each panel type have been created, which will guide how the personas interact with users. The implementation plan has been updated to reflect our progress and outline the next steps.

The execution flow for this minimal viable prototype remains:

1. User opens a simple webpage with a text input form
2. User submits a startup idea (e.g., "An AI-powered app that writes breakup texts")
3. System loads the selected gator configuration (e.g., `rex.json`)
4. Backend assembles a full prompt combining persona definition with user input
5. System sends a POST request to the LLM API endpoint
6. LLM returns a simulated in-character gator response
7. Response is displayed to the user in a simple interface

Our focus is now shifting to the backend development phase, implementing the configuration loader, prompt assembly module, and API client.

## Decision Record
- [DEC-INIT-001]: Adopted hierarchical documentation system with session tracking
  - Rationale: Need for maintaining context across multiple planning sessions
  - Status: Implemented
- [DEC-002-001]: Implemented all gator personas instead of just a subset
  - Rationale: Provides maximum flexibility for testing different persona types
  - Status: Implemented
- [DEC-002-002]: Created panel-specific prompt templates
  - Rationale: Different panel types require different prompt structures (evaluation vs. guidance vs. legal)
  - Status: Implemented

## Open Questions
- [Q-INIT-001]: Which specific gator persona(s) should be implemented for the probe?
  - Status: Resolved - All 29 personas have been implemented
- [Q-INIT-002]: Which specific LLM API will be used (Claude or GPT-4o)?
  - Status: Partially addressed - Both will be supported with Claude as default
- [Q-INIT-003]: What JSON schema should be used for gator persona configuration?
  - Status: Resolved - Schema defined in PERSONA_SCHEMA.md
- [Q-INIT-004]: What specific prompt structure will optimize persona consistency?
  - Status: Resolved - Prompt templates created for each panel type
- [Q-INIT-005]: How will we measure success in terms of persona consistency and tone accuracy?
  - Status: Partially addressed - Validation settings added to settings.json

## Session-002 Summary
Completed all persona configurations for all three panel types: Evaluation Chamber (13 personas), Pathfinder Council (9 personas), and Legal Panel (7 personas). Created panel-specific prompt templates that will guide how the system generates in-character responses. Updated the implementation plan with a detailed component breakdown and sequence. Set up the foundation for backend development.

## Next Session Focus Areas
1. Implement the configuration loader module to load and validate persona configurations
2. Create the prompt assembly module to combine template, persona, and user input
3. Build the LLM API client with support for both Claude and GPT-4o
4. Begin development of the minimal user interface for pitch submission
5. Document API endpoints and implementation details
