## Knowledge State
The VALUGATOR Probe Alpha project has made excellent progress with the completion of the configuration setup phase and now enters the implementation phase. We have successfully defined and implemented all components needed for the persona-based interaction system:

1. All 29 gator personas configured across three panels:
   - Evaluation Chamber (13 personas) for startup idea critique
   - Pathfinder Council (9 personas) for guidance and direction
   - Legal Panel (7 personas) for legal risk assessment

2. Panel-specific prompt templates created to optimize each interaction type:
   - evaluation.json: Structured for critical feedback
   - pathfinder.json: Focused on guidance and decision support
   - legal.json: Designed for legal risk analysis with mandatory disclaimers

3. Project documentation fully updated and git repository initialized with proper licensing:
   - LICENSE.txt: Proprietary license
   - LICENSE_PUBLIC.txt: Limited view-only license
   - NOTICE.md: License overview and restrictions

4. Legal AI persona limitations and guidelines established:
   - LEGAL_GATOR_LIMITS.md: Defines capabilities and boundaries for legal gators
   - Enhanced legal panel README with reliability framework
   - Updated legal prompt template with mandatory disclaimers
   - Created trust framework for appropriate vs. inappropriate legal AI uses

5. Implementation phase has begun with the completion of the project setup:
   - Node.js project structure established with Express, Jest, and ESLint
   - Directory structure created following the architecture specification
   - Placeholder components implemented for all required modules
   - Basic UI created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The execution flow for this minimal viable prototype remains:

1. User opens a simple webpage with a text input form
2. User submits a startup idea (e.g., "An AI-powered app that writes breakup texts")
3. System loads the selected gator configuration (e.g., `rex.json`)
4. Backend assembles a full prompt combining persona definition with user input
5. System sends a POST request to the LLM API endpoint
6. LLM returns a simulated in-character gator response
7. Response is displayed to the user in a simple interface

## Session-002 Summary
Completed all persona configurations for all three panel types: Evaluation Chamber (13 personas), Pathfinder Council (9 personas), and Legal Panel (7 personas). Created panel-specific prompt templates that will guide how the system generates in-character responses. Updated the implementation plan with a detailed component breakdown and sequence. Set up git repository and added license files.

## Session-003 Summary
Enhanced legal documentation by creating the LEGAL_GATOR_LIMITS.md document which clearly defines what legal gator personas can and cannot do reliably. Updated the legal prompt template to include mandatory disclaimers and limitations awareness. Modified the Legal Panel README to include a reliability framework and warning notices. Updated the Technical README and Knowledge Graph to reference the new legal limitations concept.

## Session-004 Summary
Refined the implementation plan based on gator council feedback, focusing on a more streamlined MVP approach while ensuring extensibility for future enhancements. Updated the technical architecture documentation to reflect this approach, including detailed module designs with clear extension points for the configuration loader, prompt assembly, and LLM API client components. Created comprehensive implementation specifications with code examples for each component. Established a 7-day implementation timeline with explicit daily objectives. Added new extensibility design pattern concept [CON-PROBE-011] to the knowledge graph and updated the execution flow diagram to reflect the refined architecture.

## Session-005 Summary
Created a detailed set of implementation task prompts (TASK1-TASK12) to guide the Claude Code development process. Each task prompt follows the structure defined in PROMPT_SEQUENCES.md and includes comprehensive context, requirements, steps, references, validation criteria, and next steps. Updated the Implementation Plan to reference these tasks and provide a clear development roadmap. Tasks cover the full implementation sequence from project setup through configuration loader, prompt assembly, LLM API client, Express server, frontend UI, testing, and documentation. This preparation makes the implementation phase ready to begin with Claude Code sessions.

## Session-006 Summary
Implemented TASK1_PROJECT_SETUP to create the foundational structure for the VALUGATOR Probe Alpha project. Established a complete Node.js project with Express server, ESLint for code quality, and Jest for testing. Created the directory structure matching the architecture specification, with subdirectories for config, prompt, api, utils, and public components. Set up placeholder modules for configuration loading, prompt assembly, and API client that will be expanded in subsequent tasks. Created a simple UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for startup idea submission and gator response display. Added initial tests for basic functionality and utility functions. The implementation follows the ES modules pattern and includes comprehensive configuration files for linting, testing, and version control.

## Session-007 Summary
Implemented TASK2_CONFIG_LOADER.md to create a robust configuration loader module that can read and validate all gator persona configurations, prompt templates, and global settings. The implementation follows the provider pattern for extensibility and includes thorough error handling with custom error classes and informative error messages. Key features include:

1. Class-based design with clean API and proper encapsulation
2. Asynchronous file operations for better performance
3. Configuration caching to minimize disk access
4. Comprehensive validation of loaded configurations
5. Support for fallback values when configurations are missing
6. Panel type detection for persona configurations
7. Helpers for retrieving all available persona IDs by panel
8. Extensibility through the provider pattern

Also implemented TASK3_CONFIG_LOADER_TESTS.md with a comprehensive test suite that covers all aspects of the configuration loader functionality, including error handling and edge cases.

## Session-008 Summary
Implemented TASK4_PROMPT_ASSEMBLY.md to create a powerful prompt assembly module that combines persona configurations with templates and user input to generate effective prompts for LLM APIs. The implementation provides a flexible, extensible system with sophisticated template processing capabilities. Key features include:

1. Class-based design with dependency injection for testability
2. Template variable replacement with support for nested properties
3. Array iteration using Mustache-like syntax ({{#array}}...{{/array}})
4. Robust error handling with specific error codes and messages
5. User input sanitization to prevent template injection
6. Panel type inference based on persona ID
7. Customizable formatting for different data types

Also implemented TASK5_PROMPT_ASSEMBLY_TESTS.md with a comprehensive test suite achieving >93% code coverage. The tests verify all aspects of the prompt assembly process including edge cases, error handling, and complex template processing scenarios. The implementation successfully combines all the required components (persona configuration, templates, and user input) to create structured prompts tailored to each gator persona and panel type.

## Next Session Focus Areas (SESSION-009)
1. Use Claude Code to implement TASK6_LLM_API_CLIENT.md (LLM API client module)
2. Use Claude Code to implement TASK7_LLM_API_CLIENT_TESTS.md (LLM API client tests)
3. Verify implementation against requirements
4. Update documentation with implementation details

Note: Tasks 4 and 5 (Prompt Assembly Module and Tests) have been successfully completed with a robust implementation and comprehensive test suite that provides >93% code coverage.
