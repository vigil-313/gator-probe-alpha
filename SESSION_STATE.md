## Knowledge State
The VALUGATOR Probe Alpha project has made excellent progress with the completion of the configuration setup phase and now enters the implementation phase. We have successfully defined and implemented all components needed for the persona-based interaction system:

1. All 29 gator personas configured across three panels:
   - Evaluation Chamber (13 personas) for startup idea critique
   - Pathfinder Council (9 personas) for guidance and direction
   - Legal Panel (7 personas) for legal risk assessment

2. Panel-specific prompt templates created to optimize each interaction type:
   - evaluation.json: Structured for critical feedback
   - pathfinder.json: Focused on guidance and decision support
   - legal.json: Designed for legal risk analysis with mandatory disclaimers

3. Project documentation fully updated and git repository initialized with proper licensing:
   - LICENSE.txt: Proprietary license
   - LICENSE_PUBLIC.txt: Limited view-only license
   - NOTICE.md: License overview and restrictions

4. Legal AI persona limitations and guidelines established:
   - LEGAL_GATOR_LIMITS.md: Defines capabilities and boundaries for legal gators
   - Enhanced legal panel README with reliability framework
   - Updated legal prompt template with mandatory disclaimers
   - Created trust framework for appropriate vs. inappropriate legal AI uses

5. Implementation phase has made significant progress with core components completed:
   - Node.js project structure established with Express, Jest, and ESLint
   - Directory structure created following the architecture specification
   - Configuration loader and prompt assembly modules fully implemented
   - LLM API client module implemented with provider pattern and Claude integration
   - Express server with RESTful API endpoints for generating responses and retrieving personas
   - Comprehensive test suites for all components including configuration loader, prompt assembler, LLM API client, and Express server
   - Robust error handling and validation throughout the system
   - Enhanced frontend UI with responsive design, intuitive panel selection, and themed visual elements

The execution flow for this minimal viable prototype remains:

1. User opens a simple webpage with a text input form
2. User submits a startup idea (e.g., "An AI-powered app that writes breakup texts")
3. System loads the selected gator configuration (e.g., `rex.json`)
4. Backend assembles a full prompt combining persona definition with user input
5. System sends a POST request to the LLM API endpoint
6. LLM returns a simulated in-character gator response
7. Response is displayed to the user in a simple interface
