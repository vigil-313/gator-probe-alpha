# Analyze Code Command

Analyze "$ARGUMENTS" to understand its functionality, architecture, and identify potential issues or improvements.

## Analysis Process
1. Review the code structure and organization
2. Identify key components and their relationships
3. Understand the code's purpose and functionality
4. Evaluate code quality and adherence to best practices
5. Identify potential issues, bugs, or vulnerabilities
6. Recommend improvements and refactoring opportunities

## Analysis Structure

### Code Overview
- Purpose and functionality
- Main components and structure
- Languages, frameworks, and libraries used
