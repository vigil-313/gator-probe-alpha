# Plan Feature Command

Create a comprehensive plan for implementing the feature: "$ARGUMENTS".

## Planning Process
1. Define the feature scope and objectives
2. Research similar implementations and best practices
3. Identify components and their interactions
4. Develop multiple implementation approaches
5. Evaluate tradeoffs between approaches
6. Select and justify the recommended approach
7. Break down into implementation tasks
8. Define validation criteria

## Feature Plan Structure

### Feature Overview
- Description and purpose
- User stories or use cases
- Key requirements and constraints

### Research Findings
- Similar implementations
- Relevant patterns and practices
- Technical considerations

### Implementation Approaches
For each approach:
- Description and architecture
- Component breakdown
- Advantages and disadvantages
- Technical risks and mitigations

### Recommended Approach
- Selected approach with justification
- Component architecture diagram
- Data flow and interactions
- API contracts and interfaces

### Implementation Tasks
- Sequenced development tasks
- Dependencies between tasks
- Estimated complexity

### Validation Strategy
- Test approach and coverage
- Performance criteria
- Security considerations
- Acceptance criteria

### Technical Considerations
- Scalability factors
- Maintenance requirements
- Integration points
- Deployment considerations

I'll provide a comprehensive feature plan that serves as a blueprint for implementation.
