# Implement Task Command

Implement the following task: "$ARGUMENTS".

## Approach
1. Begin by thinking through the implementation strategy step by step
2. Consider different approaches and their tradeoffs
3. Choose the most appropriate approach for this context
4. Provide a clear implementation plan
5. Implement the code following best practices
6. Add appropriate error handling
7. Include test cases to verify correctness
8. Document any assumptions or limitations

## Implementation Process
First, I'll analyze the requirements and design a solution approach:

1. Requirements analysis
2. Solution design
3. Code implementation
4. Error handling
5. Testing
6. Documentation

## Code Quality Standards
- Follow language-specific best practices
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Implement proper error handling
- Add clear comments for complex logic
- Ensure code is testable
- Consider edge cases and exceptional conditions
- Structure code for maintainability
