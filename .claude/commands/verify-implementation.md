# Verify Implementation Command

Perform a thorough verification of "$ARGUMENTS" against its requirements and specifications.

## Verification Process
1. Review the implementation requirements
2. Examine the actual implementation
3. Verify requirements coverage
4. Check code quality and best practices
5. Identify edge cases and security considerations
6. Assess test coverage and validation
7. Provide a verification summary

## Verification Checklist

### Functional Requirements
- Does the implementation fulfill all specified requirements?
- Are there any incomplete or missing features?
- Does the implementation handle edge cases correctly?

### Code Quality
- Is the code well-structured and maintainable?
- Are naming conventions and coding standards followed?
- Is there proper error handling and logging?
- Is the code appropriately commented and documented?

### Security Assessment
- Are there any potential security vulnerabilities?
- Is user input properly validated and sanitized?
- Are credentials and sensitive data handled securely?

### Performance Considerations
- Are there any obvious performance issues?
- Could any algorithms or data structures be optimized?
- Are there any resource leaks or inefficient operations?

### Testing
- Is there adequate test coverage?
- Do tests verify both normal and edge cases?
- Are there any critical scenarios not covered by tests?

## Verification Report
I'll provide a detailed verification report with:
- Requirements compliance status
- Identified issues (categorized by severity)
- Recommendations for improvement
- Overall implementation quality assessment
