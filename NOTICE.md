## ‚öñÔ∏è License Structure

- **üîí `LICENSE.txt` ‚Äì Proprietary License**  
  Prohibits all use, reuse, modification, redistribution, model training, and derivation. Covers code, outputs, character systems, interaction mechanics, visual presentation, and underlying structure.

- **üîç `LICENSE_PUBLIC.txt` ‚Äì Limited View-Only License**  
  Grants non-commercial, read-only rights to inspect the project and share screenshots for journalistic or educational purposes. Does not permit reuse, hosting, forking, or adaptation.

## üêä Intellectual Property

The VALUGATOR Probe Alpha system is a protected work of original authorship, created by **Vigil-313**. It includes:

- The "gator" personas representing different expert archetypes
- Panel-specific prompt templates for different interaction styles
- Persona configuration schemas and implementation
- Prompt assembly architecture and API integration design
- LLM-based character simulation techniques

## üö´ Specifically Prohibited Uses (Non-Exhaustive)

### 1. Copycats and Derivative Systems
- Building systems with similar multi-character evaluation panels  
- Recreating the prompt assembly, API integration, or character simulation techniques
- Mimicking the persona archetypes or interaction patterns

### 2. Prompt Engineering or API Mimicry
- Using the project's prompts or logic to build similar systems via LLMs  
- Reconstructing system mechanics using prompt chaining, API workflows, or agent orchestration  
- Attempting to replicate the experience using language model configuration  

### 3. Character Reproduction
- Repurposing gator-like characters or expert persona panels for similar use cases  
- Using the project's character structures, dialogue style, or critique tone in any derivative setting  

### 4. AI Training & Embeddings
- Training or fine-tuning machine learning models on project content or outputs  
- Creating embeddings, datasets, or vector indexes from project materials  
- Building AI experiences derived from its language, structure, or prompts  

### 5. Unauthorized Forking or Cloning
- Forking the repository publicly or privately  
- Cloning for reuse or deployment beyond view-only inspection
