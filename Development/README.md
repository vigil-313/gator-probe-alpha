# VALUGATOR Probe Alpha: Development Documentation

## Purpose
Detailed implementation documentation and Claude Code prompt sequences for the VALUGATOR Probe Alpha project, which aims to validate a single AI-powered "gator" character's interaction, focusing on tone accuracy, persona realism, and prompt-response effectiveness.

## Contents
- [DOC-DEV-IMPL-1]: Implementation Plan
- [DOC-DEV-TEST-1]: Test Strategy
- [DOC-DEV-PROMPT-1]: Claude Code Prompt Sequences

## Development Approach
This section follows a structured approach to implementing the project with Claude Code:

1. **Implementation Plan**: Breaking down the project into discrete, manageable tasks
2. **Test Strategy**: Defining validation criteria for each component
3. **Prompt Sequences**: Ready-to-use prompts for Claude Code that follow best practices
