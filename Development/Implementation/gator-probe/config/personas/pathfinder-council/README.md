## Usage

Unlike the Evaluation Chamber personas that focus on critique, Pathfinder personas are designed to help users navigate ambiguity, weigh tradeoffs, and gain internal clarity in complex or uncertain moments during their startup journey.

When using a Pathfinder persona, the prompt assembly system will generate instructions for the LLM that emphasize guidance rather than evaluation, helping users find direction rather than receiving criticism.

Each JSON file contains comprehensive details about:
- Expertise areas
- Guidance style
- Tone and language patterns
- Response structure
- Key questions and focus areas
- Vocabulary preferences
