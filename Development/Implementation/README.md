- Implementation should closely follow the specifications defined in the Technical documentation
- Test implementations should be placed in appropriate test directories within this structure

## Relationship with Documentation
- Implementation should reference technical specifications by document ID
- Code organization should reflect the architecture defined in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- Test implementations should align with test specifications in the Tests directory
