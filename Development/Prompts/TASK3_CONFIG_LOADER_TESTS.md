# IMPLEMENTATION TASK 3: Configuration Loader Unit Tests

## Context
The configuration loader module is a critical component of the VALUGATOR Probe Alpha system. It's responsible for loading and validating persona configurations, prompt templates, and application settings. To ensure its reliability, we need comprehensive unit tests.

## Objective
Create a comprehensive test suite for the configuration loader module that verifies its functionality, error handling, and edge cases.

## Starting Point
- The configuration loader module has been implemented in TASK2
- The project uses Jest for testing
- Test files should be located in the `/tests/config` directory

## Requirements
- Create comprehensive unit tests for the configuration loader
- Test both success and failure paths
- Mock the file system to avoid actual file operations during tests
- Test validation functionality
- Verify error handling behavior
- Ensure all public methods are tested

## Steps
1. Create a test file at `/tests/config/loader.test.js`

2. Set up mock file system:
   - Mock the `fs` module to return predetermined data
   - Create mock persona configurations for testing
   - Create mock prompt templates for testing
   - Create mock settings for testing

3. Test basic loading functionality:
   - Test loading a persona by ID succeeds with valid data
   - Test loading a template by panel type succeeds with valid data
   - Test loading settings succeeds with valid data

4. Test error handling:
   - Test behavior when a persona is not found
   - Test behavior when a template is not found
   - Test behavior when settings file is not found
   - Test behavior with malformed JSON

5. Test validation functionality:
   - Test validation of persona configurations
   - Test validation of prompt templates
   - Test validation of settings

6. Test edge cases:
   - Test behavior with empty configurations
   - Test behavior with minimal valid configurations
   - Test behavior with missing optional fields

7. Ensure all tests are properly organized and documented

## Constraints
- Do not perform actual file system operations in tests
- Use Jest's mocking capabilities
- Tests should run quickly and not depend on external resources
- Follow Jest best practices for test organization

## Expected Output
A comprehensive test suite that:
- Verifies all functionality of the configuration loader
- Provides good code coverage
- Includes tests for edge cases and error conditions
- Is well-organized and documented

## Validation
- All tests should pass
- Tests should provide good coverage of the configuration loader module
- Tests should verify both successful operations and error conditions
- Tests should be readable and maintainable

## Next Steps
After ensuring the configuration loader is properly tested, we will implement the prompt assembly module (TASK4) which will use the configuration loader to access persona configurations and templates.
