# Implementation Prompts

## Purpose
This directory contains individual prompt files for Claude Code implementation tasks. Each prompt follows the standard structure defined in PROMPT_SEQUENCES.md but is extracted into a separate file for clarity and easier session management.

## File Naming Convention
- TASK{N}_{TASK_NAME}.md - Individual task prompt files
- Each file corresponds to a specific implementation task

## Content Requirements
Each prompt file should include:
- Clear context and objectives
- Specific requirements and steps
- References to technical documentation
- Validation criteria
- Expected output

## Example Structure
