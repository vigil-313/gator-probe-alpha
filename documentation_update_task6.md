I've completed Implementation Task 6: LLM API Client and need to update the documentation. Here's a summary of the implementation:

## Implementation Results Summary
Implemented LLM API client module with provider pattern support, Claude integration, error handling, and retry logic. The implementation follows the extensibility design patterns defined in the project architecture and provides a clean API for communicating with LLM services.

## Technical Details
The LLM API Client implementation consists of several key components:

1. Base Provider Interface (BaseProvider class)
   - Abstract class that defines the interface for all LLM providers
   - Includes the generateResponse method that all providers must implement
   - Contains basic validation functionality common to all providers

2. Custom Error Handling (ApiError class)
   - Structured error handling with error codes and detailed information
   - Consistent error format across all API operations
   - Support for additional error details for debugging

3. Claude Provider Implementation (ClaudeProvider class)
   - Extends BaseProvider for Claude-specific functionality
   - Handles API authentication, request formatting, and response parsing
   - Maps error responses to meaningful error codes and messages

4. Provider Factory (ProviderFactory class)
   - Implements the factory pattern for creating provider instances
   - Supports dynamic provider selection based on configuration
   - Designed for extension to support additional providers in the future

5. Main LLM Client (LlmClient class)
   - Manages provider initialization and configuration
   - Provides a clean API for generating responses
   - Implements retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors
   - Integrates with the existing configuration loader module

The implementation uses ES modules and follows the class-based approach consistent with the rest of the codebase. It integrates with the configuration loader to get API settings and avoids hardcoding sensitive information.

## Changes from Original Plan
The implementation closely follows the original plan with a few minor enhancements:

- Added more comprehensive error handling with specific error codes
- Implemented exponential backoff strategy for the retry mechanism
- Added environment variable support for API keys as an additional security measure
- Enhanced the provider factory to support case-insensitive provider type matching

## Challenges Encountered
1. Error handling standardization:
   - Needed to create a consistent approach for handling both API and local errors
   - Solution: Created the ApiError class with structured error information including error codes, details, and original errors

2. Retry logic implementation:
   - Had to determine which errors are transient and should be retried
   - Solution: Implemented a retry mechanism with exponential backoff that only retries specific error types (server errors, timeouts, rate limits)

3. API authentication security:
   - Needed to ensure API keys are not hardcoded
   - Solution: Added support for environment variables and config-based API keys

## Testing and Validation
The implementation includes built-in error handling and validation:

- Provider configuration validation
- Input parameter validation
- Comprehensive error handling for API responses
- Retry mechanism for transient errors

This implementation is ready for unit testing in the next task (TASK7) which will verify:
- Provider factory returns the correct provider based on configuration
- Client correctly delegates to the provider
- Error handling works as expected for various error scenarios
- Retry mechanism correctly handles retryable errors

## Documentation Updates Needed
1. Update SESSION_STATE.md to mark Task 6 as completed
2. Update the Implementation Plan to reflect the completed task
3. Add new API client concepts to KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md:
   - Provider Pattern implementation
   - Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
   - Structured API error handling
4. Update technical documentation with details about the LLM API client architecture

Please update all relevant documentation, including:
1. SESSION_STATE.md - Mark Task 6 as completed
2. Development/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - Update status of Task 6
3. Any technical documentation affected by implementation changes
4. KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md - Add any new concepts or relationships

Conclude session and prepare handoff
```

## Documentation Update Checklist

After Claude updates the documentation, verify the following:

- [ ] SESSION_STATE.md shows Task 6 as completed
- [ ] Technical documentation includes actual implementation details
- [ ] Any deviations from the original plan are documented
- [ ] New technical decisions are added to the decision record
- [ ] Progress indicators are updated correctly
- [ ] Cross-references between documentation and implementation are maintained
- [ ] Next steps are clearly identified

## Implementation Files to Reference

List the primary files that were created or modified during this implementation task:

1. `/Development/Implementation/gator-probe/src/api/providers/base.js` - Base provider interface and error handling
2. `/Development/Implementation/gator-probe/src/api/providers/claude.js` - Claude provider implementation
3. `/Development/Implementation/gator-probe/src/api/providers/factory.js` - Provider factory implementation
4. `/Development/Implementation/gator-probe/src/api/client.js` - Main LLM client with retry logic
5. `/Development/Implementation/gator-probe/src/api/index.js` - Module exports

## Key Challenges and Solutions

Document any significant challenges encountered during implementation and how they were resolved:

1. Ensuring proper error handling across all components:
   - Created a structured ApiError class that maintains consistency across the entire module
   - Implemented specific error codes for different error scenarios
   - Added detailed error information for debugging purposes

2. Implementing the retry mechanism properly:
   - Added categorization of errors as retryable or non-retryable
   - Implemented exponential backoff strategy to prevent overwhelming the API
   - Limited retries to specific error types to avoid unnecessary retry attempts

3. Maintaining security for API keys:
   - Implemented support for environment variables for API keys
   - Added configuration validation to ensure API keys are provided securely
   - Avoided hardcoding any sensitive information in the code

## Next Steps

- Run the next implementation task:
  `./generate_dev_session.sh 7`

- Or update documentation for the next completed task:
  `./update_documentation.sh 7 "Brief implementation summary"`
